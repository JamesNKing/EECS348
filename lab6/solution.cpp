/* performs operations square matrices using funcs and arrays
 * - read matrix data from a file
 * - perform matrix operations
 * - output the results
 *
 * - max size of square matrices defined as static const 100 but actual size
 *   of square matrix will be the first line of data, being <= 100. 
 *
 * functions:
 * 1. read values from a file into a matrix
 * - store in 2D array
 *
 * 2. print a matrix
 * - values should nicely allign in a column
 *
 * 3. add two matrices and place the result in a third matrix; print result 
 *
 * 4. multiply two matrices and place result in a matrix, print result
 *
 * 5. subtract second matrix from the first and place result in third, print
 *
 * constraints: 
 * - NxN matrices, N being the static constant. Input from 'matrix_input.txt'
 * - place function prototypes before main, write their bodies in main
